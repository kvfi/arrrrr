#Err
*Arrrrr* is a statistical framework designed for people who need a strong quantitative tool without necessarily know how to program in R.

###What
Natt makes statistical programming easy:
* clear and readable syntax
* an interface that keeps user away from command lines
* out-of-the-box models for various fields

The project is currently in early-alpha stage: we are still standard library, we hope to develop Arrrrr all the way up.

####Upcoming
* a GUI
* a web-based interface
